``delma`` is a package for converting metadata statements written in markdown, 
RMarkdown or Quarto markdown to Ecological Metadata Language (EML). It is named 
for a genus of legless lizards that are endemic to Australia, whose name happens 
to contain the letters 'e', 'm' and 'l'.

The logo depicts a striped legless lizard (*Delma impar*) in the style of the 
classic mobile game 'snake', a play on the observation that Delma are often 
mistaken for snakes. ``delma`` was built and is maintained by the 
`Science & Decision Support Team <https://labs.ala.org.au/>`_ 
at the `Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) <https://www.ala.org.au/>`_.  
It was drawn by Martin Westgate.
