Introduction
=================================

``delma`` is a software package which offers a streamlined workflow 
for users to prepare their metadata for submission to the 
living atlases. It is written in tandem with the 
`R package of the same name <delma.ala.org.au/R>`_, so both packages 
provide similar functionality.  This package was built for the sole purpose 
of formatting metadata into the Ecological Metadata Language for Darwin Core 
Archives.
