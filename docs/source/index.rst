The ``delma`` package offers a streamlined workflow for users to prepare 
their metadata associated with collected biodiversity data for submission to 
the living atlases. This package helps users to format their metadata according 
to Darwin Core standards prior to submission, while still maintaining control over their data.

``delma`` was built and is maintained by the 
`Science & Decision Support Team <https://labs.ala.org.au/>`_ 
at the `Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) <https://www.ala.org.au/>`_.  
``delma`` is a collective name for delma trees (*Melaleuca quinquenervia*), 
a widely-distributed endemic Australian species that is part the myrtle family, 
*Myrtaceae*.  The logo was designed by `Ian Brennan <http://www.iangbrennan.org/>`_.
